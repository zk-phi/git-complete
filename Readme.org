* git-complete.el

Yet another completion engine powered by =git grep=

=git grep= を使った補完エンジン

** Description

=git-complete= provides an interactive command which, when invoked,
scans the current git project with =git grep= and suggests what you
may want to insert.

[[screencast.gif]]

=git-complete= CAN:

- complete *not just a symbol but the whole idiom* if appropreate,
  unlike other completion engines (rather like snippet engines)

- be used as an "omni (smart) completion" engine, i.e. =git-complete=
  tries to suggest expressions you may want to insert next, according
  to the context, *even when you don't remember it*, by grepping your
  project (class methods after a class name, typical argument for a
  function, for examples)

- be used with *no per-language configurations or dictionaries*,
  unlike snippet engines or omni-completion engines

=git-complete= CAN'T:

- complete expressions which has not been used in the git project yet

- start completion automatically, since it's a bit laggy to git grep
  over the git repo (especially for the first invokation in the
  project)

- be 100% accurate, since =git-complete= has no knowledge about the
  language you are coding in

EXTRA FEATURES:

- "autopair"
  - =git-complete= (optionally) tries to keep the parenthesis balance
    by inserting or deleting some parens if appropreate

- DWIM newline insertion
  - =git-complete= tries to insert newline after completion if you may
    want so

** Quickstart
*** Installation

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'git-complete)
#+end_src

and (optionally) bind some keys.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-c") 'git-complete)
#+end_src

*** Examples

(Consider "|" as the cursor in following examples)

Open a file under a git repo, and =M-x git-complete=,

- after a part of a package name:

  #+begin_src perl
    SHA|
  #+end_src

  completes the import statement.

  #+begin_src perl
    use Digest::SHA;
    |
  #+end_src

- after a constructor:

  #+begin_src javascript
    var foo = moment().|
  #+end_src

  suggests method names frequently used in your project.

  #+begin_src javascript
    var foo = moment().format(|
  #+end_src

  and =M-x git-complete= (again) suggests typical arguments to the
  method frequently used in your project.

  #+begin_src javascript
    var foo = moment().format("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss"|
  #+end_src

- after a newline:

  #+begin_src perl
    use strict;
    |
  #+end_src

  suggests the next line which usually follows "use strict;" in your
  project.

  #+begin_src perl
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    |
  #+end_src

** Customizations

- =git-complete-enable-autopair= : either git-complete should keep the
  parenthesis balance during completion

- =git-complete-ignore-case= : either to use =--ignore-case= option or
  not when git grepping

See "How it works" section for details:

- =git-complete-threshold=
- =git-complete-whole-line-completion-threshold=
- =git-complete-next-line-completion-threshold=
- =git-complete-repeat-completion=

** How it works

There are two methods to collect completions:

- current-line completion
- next-line completion

and each completions are classified into two types:

- whole-line completion
- omni completion

User is prompted to select one of the completions, and the selected
completion is inserted to the buffer in different ways according to
its type.

*** Completion collection
**** Current-line completion

example condition:

: React|            * consider | as the cursor

1. Collect lines containing "React" in your git repo, by =git grep=
   -ing with "React"

   : $ git grep -F -h "React"
   : import React from 'react';
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   : import React from 'react';
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   : import React from 'react';
   : import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   :     ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />);
   : import React from 'react';
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   : import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   :     ReactDOM.render(<AnotherComponent />);
   : ...

2. If some lines found in 1. appear "commonly" (as defined by
   =git-complete-whole-line-completion-threshold=), they are added to
   the completions list, as "whole-line" completions.

   : |                                                 | frequency | type       |
   : +-------------------------------------------------+-----------+------------|
   : | export default class extends React.Component{\n |       60% | whole-line |
   : | import React from 'react';\n                    |       30% | whole-line |
   : | ...                                             |       ... |        ... |

3. Trim each lines found in 1. as follows:

   - Find the query string ("React" in this case) inside the line and
     remove characters before the query and the query itself.

   - If the line has more close parens than open parens, remove
     characters after the innermost matching close paren.

   : from 'react';
   : .Component {
   : .Component {
   : from 'react';
   : .Component {
   : from 'react';
   : DOM from 'react-dom';
   : .Component {
   : DOM.render(<MyComponent />);
   : from 'react';
   : .Component {
   : DOM from 'react-dom';
   : DOM.render(<AnotherComponent />);
   : ...

4. Drop some words from the end of each lines until it gets "common"
   enough (as defined in =git-complete-threshold=), and add to the
   completions list as "omni" completions.

   : |                                                  | frequency | type       |
   : +--------------------------------------------------+-----------+------------|
   : | export default class extends React.Component {\n |       60% | whole-line |
   : | import React from 'react';\n                     |       30% | whole-line |
   : | .Component {\n                                   |       60% |       omni |
   : | from 'react';\n                                  |       30% |       omni |
   : | DOM from 'react-dom';\n                          |        5% |       omni |
   : | DOM.render(                                      |        5% |       omni |
   : | ...                                              |       ... |        ... |

   (argument to =ReactDOM.render= is dropped, since they does not
   appear "commonly")

   If some lines did not get "common" enough even if all the words are
   dropped except for one, they are not added to the completions list.

5. If no completions are found, shorten the query by one subword
   (configurable via =git-cmopletion-omni-completion-type=) and =git
   grep= again, then back to the step 3. .

   example condition:

   : var foo = bar(MyClass.|

   The query "var foo = bar(MyClass." is too specific to find some
   "common" lines, thus shortened to "foo = bar(MyClass.",
   "bar(MyClass." then "MyClass." which may give some "common" method
   names of the class "MyClass".

   Note that this case does not give any "whole-line" completions,
   since the step 2. is skipped.

**** Next-line completion

example condition:

: use strict;
: |

1. Collect lines next to "use strict;" in your git repo, by git
   grepping with "use strict;"

   : > git grep -F -h -A1 "use strict;"
   : use strict;
   : sub foo {
   : --
   : use strict;
   : use warnings;
   : --
   : use strict;
   : use warnings;
   : --
   : use strict;
   : sub bar {
   : --
   : use strict;
   : use utf8;
   : --
   : ...

2. Find "whole-line" matches as like the step 2. of "Current-line
   completion", according to
   =git-complete-next-line-completion-threshold=

   : |                         | frequency | type       |
   : +-------------------------+-----------+------------|
   : | use warnings;\n         |       80% | whole-line |
   : | use utf8;\n             |       20% | whole-line |
   : | ...                     |       ... |        ... |

   Note that next-line completion does not give any "omni"
   completions.

*** Completion insertion
**** Whole-line completion

example condition:

: React|

and the selected completion is:

: export default class extends React.Component {

1. Delete all characters in the line

   : |

2. Insert the completion with a newline and indentation

   : export default class extends React.Component {
   :     |

3. Add some close parens as needed (See "autopair" section for details)

   : export default class extends React.Component {
   :     |
   : }

**** Omni completion

example condition:

: var foo = moment().format|

and the selected completion is:

: ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss",

1. Just insert the completion

   : var foo = moment().format("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss",|

2. Add some close parens as needed (See "autopair" section for
   details) after the cursor

   : var foo = moment().format("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss",|)

** "autopair" feature

When =git-grep-enable-autopair= is non-nil, the parenthesis balance is
always kept during completion.

*** Whole-line (Next-line) completion

- Open paren

  If the completion being inserted has more *open* parens than close
  parens:

  : query:
  : validate|            * consider | as the cursor

  : completion:
  : my %params = Params::Validate::validate(@_, {

  then close parens (and an empty line) are inserted automatically.

  : result:
  : my %params = Params::Validate::validate(@_, {
  :     |
  : })

- Close paren

  If the completion being inserted has more *close* parens than open
  parens:

  : query:
  : my_awesome_function(
  :   |
  : )

  : completion:
  : an_awesome_argument)

  then the close parens in the next line is mereged into the
  replacement :

  : result:
  : my_awesome_function(
  :   an_awesome_argument)
  : |

  If no such close paren exist in the next line, then open parens are
  inserted at the beginning of the replacement, instead.

  : query:
  : my_awesome_function(
  :   |
  :   another_awesome_argument
  : );

  : result:
  : my_awesome_function(
  :   (an_awesome_argument)
  :   |
  :   foo
  : );

  (I'm not sure this behavior is very useful ... but just to keep the
  balance. maybe improved in the future versions ... ?)

*** Otherwise

- Open paren

  If the completion being inserted has more *open* parens than close
  parens:

  : query:
  : var formatted = moment.format|

  : completion:
  : ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss",

  then close parens are inserted automatically (without an empty line,
  unlike whole-line completion).

  : result:
  : var formatted = moment.format("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss",|)

- Close paren

  If the completion being inserted has more *close* parens than open
  parens:

  : query:
  : var foo = my_awesome_function(|)

  : completion:
  : an_awesome_argument), bra, bra, bra

  then the close paren and characters outside the paren (=bra, bra,
  bra=) are dropped from the completion:

  : result:
  : var foo = my_awesome_function(an_awesome_argument|)
