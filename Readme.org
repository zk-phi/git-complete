* git-complete.el

Yet another completion engine powered by =git grep=

=git grep= を使った補完エンジン

** Description

=git-complete= provides an interactive command which, when invoked,
scans the current git project with =git grep= and suggests what you
may want to insert.

[[screencast.gif]]

=git-complete= CAN:

- complete *not just a symbol but the whole idiom* if appropreate,
  unlike other completion engines (rather like snippet engines)

- be used as an "omni (smart) completion" engine, i.e. =git-complete=
  tries to suggest expressions you may want to insert next (class
  methods after a class name, typical argument for a function, for
  examples), according to the context, *even when you don't remember
  it*, by analyzing your project

- be used with *no per-language configurations or dictionaries*,
  unlike snippet engines or omni-completion engines

=git-complete= CAN'T:

- complete expressions which has not been used in the git project yet

- be 100% accurate, since =git-complete= has no knowledge about the
  language you are coding in

EXTRA FEATURES:

- "autopair"
  - =git-complete= (optionally) tries to keep the parenthesis balance
    by inserting or deleting some parens if appropreate

- DWIM newline insertion
  - =git-complete= tries to insert newline after completion if you may
    want so

** Quickstart
*** Installation

Load the library

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'git-complete)
#+end_src

and =git-complete= command is available while editing files under a
git repo.

You may want to bind some keys globally with =global-set-key=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-c") 'git-complete)
#+end_src

or locally with =define-key=:

#+begin_src emacs_lisp
  (define-key emacs-lisp-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-c") 'git-complete)
#+end_src

*** Examples

(Consider "|" as the cursor in the following examples)

Open a file under a git repo, and invoking =M-x git-complete=

- after a part of a package name:

  #+begin_src perl
    SHA|
  #+end_src

  completes the import statement.

  #+begin_src perl
    use Digest::SHA;
    |
  #+end_src

- after some words:

  #+begin_src javascript
    import router dom|
  #+end_src

  completes a line which contains all the words

  #+begin_src javascript
    import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';
    |
  #+end_src

- after a constructor:

  #+begin_src javascript
    var foo = moment().|
  #+end_src

  suggests method names frequently used in your project,

  #+begin_src javascript
    var foo = moment().format(|)
  #+end_src

  and =M-x git-complete= again suggests typical arguments to the
  method frequently passed to =format= in your project.

  #+begin_src javascript
    var foo = moment().format("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss"|)
  #+end_src

- after a newline:

  #+begin_src perl
    use strict;
    |
  #+end_src

  suggests the next line which usually follows "use strict;" in your
  project.

  #+begin_src perl
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    |
  #+end_src

** Customizations

- =git-complete-enable-autopair= : either git-complete should keep the
  parenthesis balance during completion

- =git-complete-ignore-case= : either to use =--ignore-case= option or
  not when =git grep=-ing

- =git-complete-repeat-completion= : either to repeat git-complete
  automatically or not after a successful completion

- =git-complete-limit-extension= : whether to limit extension of the
  files to search completions in, or not

  - =git-complete-major-mode-extensions-alist= : per major-mode
    extensions list used when =git-complete-limit-extension= is
    enabled

- =git-complete-fallback-function= : a function called when
  git-complete is invoked but no completions are found

- =git-complete-enable-isearch= : whether to start incremental search
  automatically or not when selecting completions

- =git-complete-repeat-completion=

** How it works
*** Types of completion candidates

Each completion candidates has a property called "whole-line"-ness.

Completions are inserted in different ways due to whether it's a
whole-line completion or not.

**** Whole-line completion

Example:

: use Digest::SHA;\n

whole-line completions are like import statements, inserted by
replacing the whole current line.

Before:

#+begin_src perl
  SHA|
#+end_src

After:

#+begin_src perl
  use Digest::SHA;
  |
#+end_src

**** Non whole-line completion

Example:

: format(

Non whole-line completions are like method name or arguments, just
inserted at the cursor position

Before:

#+begin_src javascript
  var foo = moment().|
#+end_src

After:

#+begin_src javascript
  var foo = moment().format(|)
#+end_src

(Note: close paren is inserted by the =git-complete-autopair= feature)

*** Completion collection algorithm

There are roughly two ways to collect completions:

- current-line completion
- next-line completion

and current-line completion has a fallback method called "omni"
completion (and "fuzzy" completion, as a part of "omni" completion).

**** Current-line completion

If some characters exist before the cursor in the current line,
"curent-line" completion works.

Example situation:

: React|            * consider | as the cursor

1. Collect lines which contains "React" in your git repo, via
   =git-grep=.

   : $ git grep -F -h "React"
   : import React from 'react';
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   : import React from 'react';
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   : import React from 'react';
   : import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   :     ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />);
   : import React from 'react';
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   : import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   :     ReactDOM.render(<AnotherComponent />);
   : ...

2. If some identical lines appear frequently enough (as defined by
   =git-complete-whole-line-completion-threshold=) in the result, they
   are added to the completions list, as "whole-line" completions.

   |                                                | frequency | whole-line |
   +------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|
   | export default class extends React.Component { |       60% |        yes |
   | import React from 'react';                     |       30% |        yes |
   | ...                                            |       ... |        ... |

3. Trim each lines of the result (of the step 1.) as follows:

   - Find the query string ("React" in this case) inside the line, and
     remove characters before the query (including the query itself).

   - If the line has more close parens than open parens, remove
     characters after the last matching close paren.

   : from 'react';
   : .Component {
   : .Component {
   : from 'react';
   : .Component {
   : from 'react';
   : DOM from 'react-dom';
   : .Component {
   : DOM.render(<MyComponent />);
   : from 'react';
   : .Component {
   : DOM from 'react-dom';
   : DOM.render(<AnotherComponent />);
   : ...

4. Drop some words from the end of each trimmed lines until it gets
   common enough (as defined by =git-complete-threshold=), and add to
   the completions list as non whole-line completions.

   |                                                  | frequency | whole-line |
   +--------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|
   | export default class extends React.Component {\n |       60% |        yes |
   | import React from 'react';\n                     |       30% |        yes |
   | .Component {\n                                   |       60% |         no |
   | from 'react';\n                                  |       30% |         no |
   | DOM from 'react-dom';\n                          |        5% |         no |
   | DOM.render(                                      |        5% |         no |
   | ...                                              |       ... |        ... |

   (Note that arguments to =ReactDOM.render= -- "<MyComponent />" and
   "<AnotherComponent />", are dropped, since they are not "common
   enough")

   If some lines get empty, they are just ignored.

5. If some completions are found in the process above, query user to
   select a completion in the list and insert the selected
   one. Otherwise fall back to "omni" completion.

   Before:

   : React|

   After:

   : import React from 'react';
   : |

**** Omni completion

Example situation 1:

#+begin_src javascript
  var foo = bar(MyClass.|)
#+end_src

The query "var foo = bar(MyClass" is too specific to find some
"common" lines in current-line completion. But it's clear that the
user wants to insert a class-method name of "MyClass".

Example situation 2:

#+begin_src javascript
  import 'react-router-dom'|
#+end_src

The query "import 'react-router-dom'" does not appear in the repo,
since all import statements have the form:

#+begin_src text
  import { <symbol>, ... } from <package-name>;
#+end_src

But it's clear that the user wants to import some symbols from the
'react-router-dom' package.

***** The idea

In omni completion, the query string is separated into two parts: the
context part and the query part.

By moving words from the query part to the context part by one,
=git-complete= tries to find the longest query which gives some
suitable completions. The context part affects "whole-line"-ness of
the completions.

NOTE: This behavior may be changed or disabled via
=git-complete-omni-completion-type=.

***** The process

1. Let the initial =query= be the query fallen back from the
   "current-line completion" (i.e. "var foo = bar(MyClass." for the
   example 1, and "import 'react-router-dom'" for the example 2) and
   let the initial =context= be an empty string

2. Until git-complete finds some completion candidates, repeat the
   following steps:

   1. Move a word from the =query= part to the =context= part

      For example 1:

      | Iteration | Context                            | Query                    |
      |-----------+------------------------------------+--------------------------|
      |         0 |                                    | "var foo = bar(MyClass." |
      |         1 | "var"                              | "foo = bar(MyClass."     |
      |         2 | "var", "foo ="                     | "bar(MyClass."           |
      |         3 | "var", "foo =", "bar("             | "MyClass."               |
      |         4 | "var", "foo =", "bar(", "MyClass." | ""                       |

      For example 2:

      | Iteration | Context                        | Query                       |
      |-----------+--------------------------------+-----------------------------|
      |         0 |                                | "import 'react-router-dom'" |
      |         1 | "import"                       | "'react-router-dom'"        |
      |         2 | "import", "'react-router-dom'" | "                           |

      If the =query= gets empty before finding some suitable
      completions, omni completion also fails.

   2. =git grep= with the =query= part:

      For example 1 (iteration 3):

      : $ git grep -F -h "MyClass."
      :   var awesomeVariable = MyClass.fooMethod(anArgument);
      : var anotherVariable = MyClass.barMethod(anotherArgument);
      : // Following line adds a feature to MyClass.
      : MyClass.prototype.foo = greatFunction;
      :     fooFunction(MyClass.fooMethod(yetAnotherArgument).toString());
      : var bar = new AnotherClass(MyClass.barMethod());
      : ...

      For example 2 (iteration 2):

      : $ git grep -F -h "'react-router-dom'"
      :     'react-router-dom': '^4.0.0',
      : import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';
      : import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
      : import { HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
      : // use 'react-router-dom' for routing URLs to components.
      : import { Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
      : import { Route } from react-router-dom';
      : ...

   3. Among the lines in the result of the step 2, extract lines that
      have all the words in the context part in it.

      For example 1:

      No lines contain all the context words ("var", "foo =", "bar(",
      "MyClass.") in it.

      For example 2:

      some lines

      : import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';
      : import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
      : import { HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
      : import { Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
      : import { Route } from react-router-dom';

      have the context word "import" in it.

      Other lines (looks like comment and =package.json= line) are
      dropped.

   4. If some identical lines appear frequently (as defined by
      =git-complete-whole-line-completion-threshold=) in the result of
      the step 3, they are added to the completions list as
      "whole-line" completions.

      NOTE: This behavior may be disabled via
      =git-complete-enable-fuzzy-whole-line-completion=

      For example 1:

      |   | frequency | whole-line |
      |---+-----------+------------|
      |   |           |            |

      No "whole-line" completion found for the example 1.

      For example 2:

      |                                                 | frequency | whole-line |
      |-------------------------------------------------+-----------+------------|
      | import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';       |       40% | yes        |
      | import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';        |       20% | yes        |
      | import { HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom';  |       20% | yes        |
      | import { Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom'; |       20% | yes        |
      | ...                                             |       ... | ...        |

   5. Trim each lines in the result of the step 2, as like the step 3
      of "current-line completion":

      - Find the query string inside the line, and remove characters
        before the query (including the query itself).

      - If the line has more close parens than open parens, remove
        characters after the last matching close paren.

      For example 1:

      : .fooMethod(anArgument);
      : .barMethod(anotherArgument);
      : prototype.foo = greatFunction;
      : .fooMethod(yetAnotherArgument).toString()
      : .barMethod()
      : ...

      For example 2:

      : : '^4.0.0',
      : ;
      : ;
      : ;
      : for routing URLs to components.
      : ;
      : ;
      : ...

   6. Drop some words from the end of each trimmed lines, as like the
      step 4 of "current-line copmletion", and add to the completions
      list as non whole-line completions.

      If some lines get empty, they are just ignored.

      For example 1:

      |             | frequency | whole-line |
      |-------------+-----------+------------|
      | .fooMethod( |       33% | no         |
      | .barMethod( |       33% | no         |
      | ...         |       ... | ...        |

      Note that arguments to the methods are dropped since they do not
      appear "commonly".

      For example 2:

      |                                                 | frequency | whole-line |
      |-------------------------------------------------+-----------+------------|
      | import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';       |       40% | yes        |
      | import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';        |       20% | yes        |
      | import { HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom';  |       20% | yes        |
      | import { Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom'; |       20% | yes        |
      | ;                                               |       70% | no         |
      | ...                                             |       ... | ...        |

3. If some completions are found in the process above, query user to
   select a completion in the list and insert the selected
   one. Otherwise fall back to "omni" completion.

   For example 1:

   Before:

   : var foo = bar(MyClass.|)

   After:

   : var foo = bar(MyClass.barMethod(|))

   For example 2:

   Before:

   : import 'react-router-dom'|

   After:

   : import { Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
   : |

**** Next-line completion

If no characters exist before the cursor in the current line,
"next-line" completion works, which use the previous line as the
query.

example condition:

: use strict;
: |

1. Collect lines next to "use strict;" in your git repo, by git
   grepping with "use strict;"

   : > git grep -F -h -A1 "use strict;"
   : use strict;
   : sub foo {
   : --
   : use strict;
   : use warnings;
   : --
   : use strict;
   : use warnings;
   : --
   : use strict;
   : sub bar {
   : --
   : use strict;
   : use utf8;
   : --
   : ...

2. Find "whole-line" matches as like the step 2. of "Current-line
   completion", according to
   =git-complete-next-line-completion-threshold=

   : |                         | frequency | type       |
   : +-------------------------+-----------+------------|
   : | use warnings;\n         |       80% | whole-line |
   : | use utf8;\n             |       20% | whole-line |
   : | ...                     |       ... |        ... |

   (next-line completion does not give any "non whole-line"
   completions for now)

** "autopair" feature

When =git-grep-enable-autopair= is non-nil, the parenthesis balance is
always kept during completion.

*** Whole-line (Next-line) completion

- Open paren

  If the completion being inserted has more *open* parens than close
  parens:

  : query:
  : validate|            * consider | as the cursor

  : completion:
  : my %params = Params::Validate::validate(@_, {

  then close parens (and an empty line) are inserted automatically.

  : result:
  : my %params = Params::Validate::validate(@_, {
  :     |
  : })

- Close paren

  If the completion being inserted has more *close* parens than open
  parens:

  : query:
  : my_awesome_function(
  :   |
  : )

  : completion:
  : an_awesome_argument)

  then the close parens in the next line is mereged into the
  replacement :

  : result:
  : my_awesome_function(
  :   an_awesome_argument)
  : |

  If no such close paren exist in the next line, then open parens are
  inserted at the beginning of the replacement, instead.

  : query:
  : my_awesome_function(
  :   |
  :   another_awesome_argument
  : );

  : result:
  : my_awesome_function(
  :   (an_awesome_argument)
  :   |
  :   foo
  : );

  (I'm not sure this behavior is very useful ... but just to keep the
  balance. maybe improved in the future versions ... ?)

*** Otherwise

- Open paren

  If the completion being inserted has more *open* parens than close
  parens:

  : query:
  : var formatted = moment.format|

  : completion:
  : ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss",

  then close parens are inserted automatically (without an empty line,
  unlike whole-line completion).

  : result:
  : var formatted = moment.format("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss",|)

- Close paren

  If the completion being inserted has more *close* parens than open
  parens:

  : query:
  : var foo = my_awesome_function(|)

  : completion:
  : an_awesome_argument), bra, bra, bra

  then the close paren and characters outside the paren (=bra, bra,
  bra=) are dropped from the completion:

  : result:
  : var foo = my_awesome_function(an_awesome_argument|)

** Contributions

Contributions are welcome!

You may contribute to the project in different ways:

- Improve my English

  Since I'm not an English speaker, my documents may not be very
  fluent and it will be a great contribution to fix them!

- Feature request / implementation

  You may send me a feature request in the "issues" section of this
  repository. If you can implement by yourself, it's *super* helpful
  to send me a "pull request" instead! Note that in some cases, you
  and me need to discuss about the new feature before implementing /
  merging it (to make git-complete better).

- Bug report / fix

  You may report me a bug in "issues" section of this repository. If
  you can fix it by yourself, it's *sooo nice* to send me a "pull
