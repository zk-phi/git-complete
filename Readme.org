* git-complete.el

Yet another completion engine powered by =git grep=

=git grep= を使った補完エンジン

** Description

=git-complete= provides an interactive command which, when invoked,
scans the current git project with =git grep= and suggests what you
may want to insert.

[[screencast.gif]]

=git-complete= CAN:

- complete *not just a symbol but the whole idiom* if appropreate,
  unlike other completion engines (rather like snippet engines)

- be used as an "omni (smart) completion" engine, i.e. =git-complete=
  tries to suggest expressions you may want to insert next, according
  to the context, *even when you don't remember it*, by grepping your
  project (class methods after a class name, typical argument for a
  function, for examples)

- be used with *no per-language configurations or dictionaries*,
  unlike snippet engines or omni-completion engines

=git-complete= CAN'T:

- complete expressions which has not been used in the git project yet

- start completion automatically, since it's a bit time-consuming to
  grep over the project (especially for the first invokation)

- be 100% accurate, since =git-complete= has no knowledge about the
  language you are coding in

EXTRA FEATURES:

- "autopair"
  - =git-complete= (optionally) tries to keep the parentheses balanced
    by inserting or merging some parens if appropreate

- DWIM newline insertion
  - =git-complete= tries to insert newline after completion if you may
    want so

** Quickstart
*** Installation

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'git-complete)
#+end_src

and (optionally) bind some keys.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-c") 'git-complete)
#+end_src

You may also invoke git-complete with =M-x git-complete=.

Note that you also need to install =git= if it's not installed yet.

*** Examples

(Consider "|" as the cursor in following examples)

- after a part of a package name:

  #+begin_src perl
    SHA|
  #+end_src

  git-complete completes the import statement.

  #+begin_src perl
    use Digest::SHA;
    |
  #+end_src

- after a constructor:

  #+begin_src javascript
    var foo = moment().|
  #+end_src

  git-complete suggests method names frequently used in your project.

  #+begin_src javascript
    var foo = moment().format(|
  #+end_src

  and =M-x git-complete= (again) suggests typical arguments to the
  method frequently used in your project.

  #+begin_src javascript
    var foo = moment().format("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss"|
  #+end_src

- after a newline:

  #+begin_src perl
    use strict;
    |
  #+end_src

  suggests next line which usually follows the line =use strict;= in
  your project.

  #+begin_src perl
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    |
  #+end_src

** Customizations

- =git-complete-enable-autopair= : either git-complete should keep the
  parenthesis balance during completion

- =git-complete-ignore-case= : either to use =--ignore-case= option or
  not when git grepping

- =git-complete-grep-function= : function used to grep over the
  repo. git-complete by default uses =git grep= but you may tell
  git-complete to use =rg= instead by setting this variable to
  ='git-complete-ripgrep=

See "How it works" section for the options below:

- =git-complete-threshold=
- =git-complete-whole-line-completion-threshold=
- =git-complete-next-line-completion-threshold=
- =git-complete-repeat-completion=

** How it works

There are three methods to collect completions:

- whole current-line completion
- omni current-line completion
- omni next-line completion

User is prompted to select one of the completions, and the selected
completion is inserted to the buffer in different ways according to
its type.

*** Completion collection
**** Whole current-line completion

example:

: React|            * consider | as the cursor

1. Collect lines with "React" in your git repo, by =git grep=-ing with
   "React"

   : $ git grep -F -h "React"
   : import React from 'react';
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   : import React from 'react';
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   : import React from 'react';
   : import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   :     ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />);
   : import React from 'react';
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   : import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   :     ReactDOM.render(<AnotherComponent />);
   : ...

2. If some identical lines appear "frequently" (as defined by
   =git-complete-whole-line-completion-threshold=), they are added to
   the completions list, as "whole-line" completions.

   : |                                                 | frequency | type       |
   : +-------------------------------------------------+-----------+------------|
   : | export default class extends React.Component{\n |       60% | whole-line |
   : | import React from 'react';\n                    |       30% | whole-line |
   : | ...                                             |       ... |        ... |

**** Omni current-line completion

example:

: React|            * consider | as the cursor

1. Collect lines with "React" in your git repo, by =git grep=-ing with
   "React"

   : $ git grep -F -h "React"
   : import React from 'react';
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   : import React from 'react';
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   : import React from 'react';
   : import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   :     ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />);
   : import React from 'react';
   : export default class extends React.Component {
   : import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   :     ReactDOM.render(<AnotherComponent />);
   : ...

2. Trim each lines found in 1. as follows:

   - Find the query string ("React" in this case) inside the line and
     remove characters before the query and the query itself.

   - If the line has more close parens than open parens, remove
     characters after the innermost matching close paren.

   : from 'react';
   : .Component {
   : .Component {
   : from 'react';
   : .Component {
   : from 'react';
   : DOM from 'react-dom';
   : .Component {
   : DOM.render(<MyComponent />);
   : from 'react';
   : .Component {
   : DOM from 'react-dom';
   : DOM.render(<AnotherComponent />);
   : ...

3. If some identical idioms appear "frequently" (as defined in
   =git-complete-threshold=) at the beginning of the lines, add the
   idioms to the completions list as "omni" completions.

   : |                         | frequency | type |
   : +-------------------------+-----------+------|
   : | .Component {\n          |       60% | omni |
   : | from 'react';\n         |       30% | omni |
   : | DOM from 'react-dom';\n |        5% | omni |
   : | DOM.render(<            |        5% | omni |
   : | ...                     |       ... |  ... |

   Note that =DOM.render(<= is added to the list but
   =DOM.render(<MyComponent />)= is not, since it does not appear
   "frequently".

4. If no completions are found, shorten the query by one subword
   (configurable via =git-cmopletion-omni-completion-type=) from the
   beginning and =git grep= again, then back to the step 3. .

   example:

   : var foo = bar(MyClass.|

   The query =var foo = bar(MyClass.= is too specific to find some
   "frequent" idioms, thus shortened to =foo = bar(MyClass.=,
   =bar(MyClass.= then =MyClass.= which may give some "frequent"
   idioms: method names of the class =MyClass=.

   When the query is shortened, all completions will be type of
   "omni", since the step 2. is skipped.

**** Omni next-line completion

example:

: use strict;
: |

1. Collect lines next to =use strict;= in your git repo, by grepping
   with =use strict;=

   : > git grep -F -h -A1 "use strict;"
   : use strict;
   : sub foo {
   : --
   : use strict;
   : use warnings;
   : --
   : use strict;
   : use warnings;
   : --
   : use strict;
   : sub bar {
   : --
   : use strict;
   : use utf8;
   : --
   : ...

2. Find identical lines as like the step 2. of "Whole current-line
   completion", according to
   =git-complete-next-line-completion-threshold=

   : |                 | frequency | type |
   : +-----------------+-----------+------|
   : | use warnings;\n |       80% | omni |
   : | use utf8;\n     |       20% | omni |
   : | ...             |       ... |  ... |

3. If no completions are found, shorten the query and repeat like the
   step 3 of "Omni current-line completion".

*** Completion insertion
**** Whole-line completion

example:

: React|

when you select a "whole-line" completion like below:

: export default class extends React.Component {\n

then

1. Delete all characters in the current line

   : |

2. Insert the completion

   : export default class extends React.Component {
   :     |

3. Add some close parens as needed (if "autopair" feature is not disabled)

   : export default class extends React.Component {
   :     |
   : }

**** Omni completion

example:

: var foo = moment().format|

when you select a "omni" completion like below:

: ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss",

then

1. Insert the completion after the cursor

   : var foo = moment().format("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss",|

2. Add some close parens as needed (if "autopair" feature is not
   disabled) after the cursor

   : var foo = moment().format("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss",|)
